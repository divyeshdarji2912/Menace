Steps to run the project:
1) Clone this project and use any IDE to open the project
2) We have pom.xml file where we have inserted dependencies for JUnit and Log4J
3) Kindly build the project first
4) Open the ConsoleController.java file located in src/main/java/player directory

6) Once the MENACE is trained you can start playing the game with the MENACE which is trained.
7) You can view the logging details in the output.txt file located in the src/main/java/output directory. It will take some time to reflect on your IDE but it will be available on in your local directory immediately so please check there
